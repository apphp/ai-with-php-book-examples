    <p>
        Linear transformations are functions between vector spaces that respect the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. They
        serve as a natural bridge between abstract vector spaces and concrete matrix operations, allowing us to represent complex mathematical
        relationships in elegant, computable forms. Just as vectors generalize the notion of arrows in space, linear transformations generalize the
        idea of stretching, rotating, and reflecting those arrows in consistent, predictable ways.
